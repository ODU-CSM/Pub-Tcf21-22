## GRN of DE `r feature`s

```{r de-gene} 
# use only DE feature
# load DE feature
deRes <- read.csv(inputParams$deRes)
deRes <- deRes[sort(deRes[, 2], index.return = TRUE)$ix, ]
deFeats <- deRes[1:nTopDe, 1]

# check if all DE features are in read counts file
if (length(which(!(deFeats %in% expCntFull[, expIdCol]))) > 0) {
  warning(paste0('There is(are) %d DE %s(s) that do not have data in the expression read count ',
                 'data file and will be excluded from analysis. They are: %s.\n'), 
          length(which(!(deFeats %in% expCntFull$gene_id))), feature, printNames(deFeats[!(deFeats %in% expCntFull$gene_id)]))
  deFeats <- deFeats[deFeats %in% expCntFull[, expIdCol]]
}
```

The top `r nTopDe` most differentially expressed `r feature`s found in the given file that provides the results from differential tests were included in the subsequent analysis.
