```{r aln-data}
accSampCom <- unlist(accSOfGrp[grpInCom])
expSampCom <- unlist(expSOfGrp[grpInCom])
accUseCom <- accUse[, accSampCom]
# remove inaccessible
accUseCom <- accUseCom[apply(accUseCom, 1, function(x) return(length(which(x >= minTpm)) > 0)), ]
expUseCom <- expUse[, expSampCom]
# remove unexpressed
expUseCom <- expUseCom[apply(expUseCom, 1, function(x) return(length(which(x >= minTpm)) > 0)), ]
# peak data
peakTpmCom <- peakTpm[, accSampCom]

# compose the full data of feature expression and promoter accessibility
allFeatsCom <- unique(c(rownames(expUseCom), rownames(accUseCom)))
accFullCom <- extractData(accUseCom, allFeatsCom)
expFullCom <- extractData(expUseCom, allFeatsCom)

# calculate group average
accGrpAveCom <- calcGrpAve(accFullCom, grpInCom, accSOfGrp)
expGrpAveCom <- calcGrpAve(expFullCom, grpInCom, expSOfGrp)

# normalize each row in the data to have mean 0 and std 1
expNormCom <- zscore(expUseCom)
accNormCom <- zscore(accUseCom)
peakNormCom <- zscore(peakTpmCom)
```

There are `r length(grpInCom)` sample groups in common between the two types of data, which are `r printNames(grpInCom)`. Only data from these groups will be used in subsequent analyses where paired data are required, for example, the computation of correlation between promoter accessibility and `r feature` expression. In these analyses, `r feature`s (and promoters) that were not expressed (accessible) in any sample (with a TPM $\ge$ `r minTpm`) from the shared groups will be excluded.
